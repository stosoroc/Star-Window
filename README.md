# Star-Window
Star Window ‚Äî Starfield with Layered Effects
This code creates an interactive starfield animation in your browser, simulating a flight through space with layers of stars and visual effects. It is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and runs entirely in the browser.

What does the code do?
Draws three layers of stars moving from right to left across the screen, creating a parallax effect:

Foreground (near) stars: White, larger, and brighter.
Middle (mid) stars: Smaller, with a mix of white, red, blue, and yellow colors. These stars flicker and sometimes display radiant spikes during a flash.
Background (far) stars: Smallest and dimmest, with subtle motion.
Foreground stars have two visual effects:

Glow effect: A soft white halo around each star.
3D gradient effect: The star disk itself appears glossy and volumetric.
Middle-layer stars have a special effect:

Some stars randomly flicker ("flash"). When a flash occurs, these stars briefly display bright spikes ("star rays") that quickly fade out, mimicking real star twinkling.
Meteorites: Occasionally, bright lines ("meteorites") move across the screen for extra visual interest.

Interactive controls:

Play/Pause button (‚è∏Ô∏è/‚ñ∂Ô∏è): Pauses or resumes the animation.
Fullscreen toggle (‚õ∂/üóó): Switches between fullscreen and windowed mode.
Distance Counter: Displayed at the top center, it shows the "distance" traveled through the starfield, updating as the animation runs.

Mouse Controls:

Clicking and holding on the canvas speeds up the starfield and adds a shaking effect (simulating a boost or acceleration).
Releasing the mouse slows the stars back to normal speed.
Automatic Boosts: Every set distance, a "boost" is triggered automatically, temporarily increasing speed and shaking the view.

Key Elements to Notice After Opening the Page
Starfield Animation:

Watch the three layers of stars move leftward at different speeds. Notice how the larger, brighter foreground stars have a soft glow and a glossy 3D look.
Observe the middle-layer stars: occasionally, some will "flash" (become very bright), and at those moments, you will see star-shaped rays (spikes) radiate from them, fading out quickly.
The background stars provide depth but are less visually striking.
Meteorites:

From time to time, faint white streaks (meteorites) appear and move from right to left.
Controls (Top-Right Corner):

Pause/Play button: Click to pause or resume the animation.
Fullscreen button: Click to toggle fullscreen mode for an immersive experience.
Distance Counter (Top Center):

Displays a number like - 012.345 - that increases as you travel through the starfield.
Mouse Interaction:

Click and hold anywhere on the canvas to accelerate the stars and see the screen shake slightly (indicating a warp or boost).
Release the mouse to return to normal speed.
Automatic Boosts:

As the distance counter increases, you may see periodic boosts with increased speed and shaking, even without using the mouse.
Technical Highlights / What to Modify
Visual Effects:

The parameters for star glow, 3D effect, spike duration, and brightness can be adjusted in the JavaScript code for different visual styles.
Spike brightness and fade speed are controlled by variables in the drawStarSpikes and star update functions.
Performance:

The animation uses requestAnimationFrame for smoothness and adapts to window resizing.
Customization:

You can easily change the number of stars, their colors, brightness, or the frequency of meteorites by editing the relevant variables at the top of the script.
Summary
This starfield is an interactive, visually rich simulation designed for both aesthetics and engagement. Pay special attention to the layered parallax, the glowing and glossy close stars, the twinkling/flickering mid-layer stars with their quick starburst spikes, and the immersive controls at the top of the screen.
